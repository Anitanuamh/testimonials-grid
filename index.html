        <div class="body">i was an EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp
            .i've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing 
            experience here. i signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly
            fun! i entrolled shortly thereafter. the next 12 weeks was the best - and most
            grueling -time of my life. sine completing the course. i've
            successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.

                    never written a line of code. i needed <br>
                    some structure from professionals <br>
                    who can help me learn programming <br>
                    step by step. i was encouraged to <br>
                    enroll by a former student of theirs <br>
                    who can only say wonderful things <br>
                    about the program. The entire <br>
                    curriculum and staff did not <br>
                    disappoint. They were very hands-on <br>
                    and i never had to wait long for <br>
                    assistance. The agile team project, in <br>
                    particular, was outstanding. it took <br>
                    my learning to the next level in a way <br>
                    that no tutorial could ever have. in <br>
                    fact, i've often reffered to it during <br>
                    as an example of my <br> 
                    development experience. it certainly <br>
                    helped me land a job as a full-stack <br>
                    developer after receiving multiple <br>
                    offers. 100% recommended!"
